# Earthquake Data Sorting
This program uses the Python libraries cs103 (course library), typing, csv, and matplotlib to analyse data on every global earthquake in the last 60 years from a csv file to calculate and plot the average magnitude and average deaths caused for different periods in order to determine whether or not there is a relationship between earthquake magnitude and deaths. 

When run, the program produces six different graphs; the first five are tests, and the sixth graph is the final result using the full dataset of 2403 earthquakes:
